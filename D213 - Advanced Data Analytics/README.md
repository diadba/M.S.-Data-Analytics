Course Overview:

Data Mining I expands predictive modeling into nonlinear dimensions, enhancing the capabilities and effectiveness of the data analytics lifecycle. In this course, learners implement supervised models - specifically classification and prediction data mining models - to unearth relationships among variables that are not apparent with more surface-level techniques. The course provides frameworks for assessing models' sensitivity and specificity.
